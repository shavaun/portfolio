# Intro

My primary passion is solving problems, regardless of the type of problem or its source. I love writing documentation, automating tests, and helping my team work as efficiently as possible.

Outside of work, I spend my time working on coding projects, learning the ukulele, painting, going to the beach, and playing with my adorable cat.


# Background

I spent much of my school years reading and writing. After filling many notebooks with my indecipherable handwriting and being totally unable to read what I'd previously written, computers became my tool of choice. I used my computer to learn basic programming and later applied those skills to web programming. I've since improved my handwriting, but I still prefer the computer.

My career began in telecommunications. As a network engineer, I learned more about Linux and had my first real exposure to servers. I learned about handling emergency situations, and how to apply my technical skills in real world situations. Throughout that time, I was always writing documentation and test scenarios. Not only did no one else want to do it, but it helped me learn so I was always happy to volunteer.

To pursue a technical writing role, I left telecommunications for the software development industry. There I learned about product management, Agile, technical writing, and gained experience with software development processes in general. I helped with testing as well, including writing automated tests. Working in various roles has allowed me to develop a love for different industries and the teams that now make the world go round.
