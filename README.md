## Shavaun's Portfolio Repo

This is the repo for my Technical Writing portfolio. To view the site, go to https://shavaun.github.io/portfolio/. It uses the following frameworks, libraries, and tools:

- [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Jami Gibbs' Phantom theme](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom) 
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (C) 2011 - 2016 Twitter, Inc., MIT
- [Wow](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW) (C) 2014 - 2016 Matthieu Aussaguel , GPL
- [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) (C) 2016 Daniel Eden, MIT

If you'd like to use this theme for your own portfolio, use Jami Gibbs' instructions in their repo. I have removed some features that I don't use, so I suggest using their original version instead of cloning this repo.
